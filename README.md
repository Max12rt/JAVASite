This project implements a client-server architecture for a wine-selling website, using artificial intelligence to assist in wine selection. The selection is based on either an LLM (Large Language Model) or an arbiter algorithm to provide the best possible recommendation.
In the software, pages with the following graphical user interface (GUI) were implemented, namely:

Figure 4.1 – Example of the authentication page
Figure 4.1 presents the login page, which contains two input fields. The user can log in by clicking the "Log in" button, or click the "Registration" button, which redirects the user to the signup page.

Figure 4.2 – Example of the registration page
In Figure 4.2, there are four fields to fill in: the user's name or nickname, email, password, and password confirmation. After completing all fields, the user can create a profile and access the main page.

Figure 4.3 – Example of the main page
From the main page shown in Figure 4.3, users can navigate to a page with a selection of alcoholic beverages sourced from a third-party website, and then proceed to purchase them. Additionally, users can fill out a form to receive a cocktail recipe or submit preferences and receive an AI-generated drink suggestion, with an option to order it.

Figure 4.4 – Example of the shop page
The shop page shown in Figure 4.4 allows users to find drinks from a curated database, compiled using free drink databases. Users can also follow a provided link to order a selected beverage.

Figure 4.5 – Example of the drink selection form
Figure 4.5 presents the WinePreferenceForm, which enables the user to receive a drink recommendation from the AI. The form contains several fields for describing alcohol characteristics using various criteria, along with a text field for additional preferences, restrictions, etc.

Figure 4.6 – Example of a recommended drink
Users are then able to follow a generated link to a third-party website to purchase the recommended drink. Alternatively, by clicking another button, the user can restart the process and attempt to find a different recommendation.

For the software to function properly, a running Tomcat server launched by the Spring framework is required. This can be done on a personal computer or, for larger projects, on a dedicated server. Currently, the server runs on a local PC connected to the internet.

Additionally, a running MongoDB server is required, where the database is stored. Both the application server and the database must have internet access to enable communication with each other and with the user.

To use the software, the user only needs internet access and a web browser. The user must register or log in to access the site. The main functionality is to navigate to the form, fill it out, wait between 2 to 5 seconds, and receive an AI-generated drink recommendation. The user can then follow a provided link to order the drink or try to find another one.
